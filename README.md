In this project i have scraped the data from  I scraped phone data from Flipkart, cleaned it using Pandas, and conducted in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Leveraging my skills in web development, I built a user-friendly web application using Streamlit and deployed it for public access.

Data Collection & Cleaning: Utilized Beautiful Soup for web scraping and Pandas for data cleaning, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Uncovered valuable insights through thorough EDA, revealing trends and patterns in the phone data.

Model Development: Developed a robust linear regression model for price prediction, leveraging machine learning techniques.

Web Application Development: Designed and implemented a seamless web application using Streamlit, providing users with an intuitive interface to interact with the model.
